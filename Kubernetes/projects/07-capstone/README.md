# Capstone Project: AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service

For the capstone project in the course, we focused on moving away from our local development environment (`minikube`) and start to learn
about the workflow, deployment options, etc. involved in deploying software to a production cloud environment: AWS (Amazon Web
Services).
