# AWS EC2 Deployment

AWS EC2 is a service that allows you to spin up and manage your own remote machines

For our project there are a few steps we need to take:

1. Create and launch EC2 instance, VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and Security Group
2. Configure security group to expose all required ports to WWW
3. Connect to instance (SSH), install Docker and run our container
